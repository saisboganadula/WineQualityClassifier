Wine Quality Classification- Sai Sukheshwar Boganadula- Bala Subramanyam Pavan Kumar KasturiDescription:This code implements a wine quality classifier on the red wine dataset using two machine learning models - Random Forest and SVM. It handles class imbalance using SMOTE oversampling. Performance is evaluated using repeated cross-validation and finally on the test set.Contents:- wine_quality.py - Main Python code - winequality-red.csv - Input dataset- report.pdf - Writeup documenting approach and resultsRequired Libraries:- Pandas - Numpy- scikit-learn- imbalanced-learnHow to Run:1. Download all files and keep in same directory2. Ensure all required libraries are installed 3. Run wine_quality.py using Python 3 4. Full output will be printed showing model evaluation5. Plots generated will be saved in current folderThe code does the following:- Loads red wine data- Splits data into train-test sets- Scales features  - Tunes RF and SVM models using cross-validation - Handles class imbalance with SMOTE- Retrains best model on balanced dataset- Evaluates model performance on test setThe report provides full details on:- Data exploration and preprocessing - Model implementation and selection- Performance evaluation- Insights and analysis
